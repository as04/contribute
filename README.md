## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'contribute'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install contribute

## Usage

You will need you api access token. [Github people have written about how can you get those magic bits](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens).

Rename `.token.yml.exmaple` to `.token.yml`.
```
cp .token.yml.example .token.yml
```

Replace `your_github_token` in `.token.yml` with your github token.

### Look at the stars, Look how they shine for you

You can chain various options. For example, following command will return repos with primary language ruby and whose stars are between 1000 and 5000:

```Ruby
Contribute::Finder.new.language("ruby").stars(1000,5000).find
```

You can also use any search string as per [github documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code/) to find repos.

```Ruby
Contribute::Finder.new("language:ruby").find
```

#### Finding repos
You can filter out repo of your interest using following methods:
* `forks`
* `stars`
* `langauge`

#### Sorting and ordering
Sort repos by calling `sort_by`. Call `order` with `desc` or `asc` to order your repos in descending and ascending order respectively.
```Ruby
# valid option for sorting: created, updated, stars, forks
Contribute::Finder.new("language:ruby").sort_by('stars').order('asc')find
```
Use `Contribute::ExtendedSort` module if you would like sort by name, size, watchers and issues.
```Ruby
repos = Contribute::Finder.new("language:ruby").find
Contribute::ExtendedSort.sort_by!(repos, 'size')
```
